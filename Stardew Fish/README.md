Created an adjustable R graph of the times, seasons and locations of all of the fish in Stardew Valley.

I had trouble remembering how to get all of the fish, so I realized that all this data was accessible on 
the Stardew wiki but it wasn't very easy to interpret. So, I exported the data to a .csv, cleaned it,
and made it into graphs that were able to be filtered by all of those categories listed above.

It really helped me with my in-game fishing, and with applying my R skills to something new and fun!
